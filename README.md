# Chrome-Password_Stealer
When you request Google Chrome to save your password on a given website, it stores it in a "Login Data" file (sqlite database file).<br>
In order to securely store the password, the password is encrypted using user's window's credentials.<br>
This program decrypts the passwords in user's machine and then copys them to the same directory  in which program is present.<br>
So if the executable version of this program is plugged into any computer running windows and Google Chrome, running this program will copy all the Chrome saved passwords into a text file.<br>
Please don't misuse this program. I will not be responsible for any destructive outcomes of this program.<br>
